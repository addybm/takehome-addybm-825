Take-home assignment 8/25

Instructions for running this program:

    This uses a command-line interface that can be run by starting "main.py".
    In order to run this, you must have a file named "database.json" that
    contains all of the information about your properties, including url
    strings that are associated with images.
    
    This interface gives you options to browse properties, look at image urls,
    and modify the order of those images. When you quit, any changes will be
    saved in "database.json".
    
    The video demo was too large to attach to this README.
